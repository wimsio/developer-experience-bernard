# Welcome to the Intersect MBO Developer Experience Working Group

## 🎯 Our Mission 
We are a community of `Developer Advocates` from `IntersectMBO` focused on enhancing the developer experience within the Cardano ecosystem. Our goal is to identify, address, and improve key aspects of the development process to make building on Cardano more accessible, efficient, and rewarding.

We believe in transparency and sharing our personal experiences. These interviews offer a glimpse into our backgrounds, motivations, and commitment to improving developer experience in the Cardano ecosystem.
